# Meld-Documentation

The Meld Sandbox is an open-source sandbox that can be used to create, test, and validate healthcare applications. As a user and/or contributor of the Meld sandbox, you may find yourself in need of documentation. This repository is where you will find Meld documentation. Large documents will be uploaded into the **Code** section of this repo, and other documentation that may need to be updated more frequenty will be located in the **Wiki** section of this repo. 

If you have any comments or suggestions about existing or new documentation, please reach out to support@interop.community 

If you would like to help edit, improve, or create documentation please navigate to the Contributor's Guide to Meld which will explain how you can help. **(Coming Soon)**
